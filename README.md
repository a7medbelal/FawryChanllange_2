##  Main Features

- **Add Books to Inventory**  
  Supports adding multiple types of books including paper books, ebooks, and demo books.

- **Buy a Book by ISBN**  
  Allows customers to purchase books using their ISBN, quantity, email, and address.

- **Different Book Types**
  - **PaperBook**: Can be shipped and has stock quantity.
  - **EBook**: Has a file type and is sent by email (no quantity limit).
  - **DemoBook**: Only for display, not for sale.

- **Remove Outdated Books**  
  Books older than a fixed number of years are removed from inventory automatically.

- **Automatic Handling of Purchase Logic**  
  Each book type handles its own buying logic using OOP principles (like overriding a `Buy` method).

- **All outputs are prefixed with "Quantum book store"**  
  As required by the task for clarity and branding.
